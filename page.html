        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Pranav Palavarapu! I am currently a Sophmore at University of Maryland-College Park. I am a computer science major with a minor in statistics. As someone who lives in an apartment off campus, I have to cook food for myself most of the week. The thing is, I love to cook! On this webpage you will find some of my favorite dishes that I have made in the past so I hope you enjoy them!</p>
